# Python-Chat
This is a small chat application written in python using Tkinter and Sockets. It also uses the sha2526 hashing algorithm to hash any passwords stored.

Once the server file is ran you will need to enter the IP address of the machine and the port that you want the server to run on. The server will then attempt to bind and if unsuccesful will continue to try until it can. 

The client file will also ask for a IP address and a port which should match the information that the server is using. Once connected you can either make an account or login and imediatly begin chatting.
